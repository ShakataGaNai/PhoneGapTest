== About ==
This application is nothing more than a massive "Hello World" for the PhoneGap
framework ( http://phonegap.com/ ).  I took an example PhoneGap app from 
Dreamweaver CS 5.5 to use as the UI base.  Each screen is one item from the 
API documentation ( http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.6.0/index.html ).
